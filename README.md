## Installation

1. Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:
    
    ```
   $ flutter pub add kalender
    ```
2. Import it:   
    
    ```dart
   import 'package:kalender/kalender.dart';
    ```

## Usage

1. Create a custom class to store your data.
    ```dart
    class Event {
      final String title;
      final Color color;
      
      Event(this.title, this.color);
    }
    ```

2. Create a EventsController
    ```dart
    final eventsController = EventsController<Event>();
    ```
    Add events to the controller
    ```dart
    eventsController.addEvent(
      CalendarEvent(
        dateTimeRange: DateTimeRange(), // The DateTimeRange of the event.
        modifiable: true, // Change this to false if you do not want the user to modify the event.
        eventData: Event(  // The custom object that you want to link to the event.
            title: 'Event 1',
            color: Colors.blue,
        ),
      ),
    );
    ```

3. Create a CalendarController
    ```dart
    final calendarController = CalendarController();
    ```

4. Create tile builders
   ```dart
   Widget _tileBuilder(event, tileConfiguration) => Widget()
   Widget _multiDayTileBuilder(event, tileConfiguration) => Widget()
   Widget _scheduleTileBuilder(event, date) => Widget()
   ```

5. Create a CalendarView
    ```dart
    CalendarView(
      eventsController: eventsController,
      calendarController: calendarController,
      tileBuilder: _tileBuilder(),
      multiDayTileBuilder: _multiDayTileBuilder(),
      scheduleTileBuilder _scheduleTileBuilder(),
    )       
    ```
    
### Mobile rescheduling, resizing

To reschedule events on mobile the user needs to trigger a longPress and then drag the event to the desired location.

The only way for events to be resized on mobile is by keeping them selected so the handlebars are built, only one handle bar can be used at a time.
To do this you can do the following:

Configure the event handlers like so. 
```dart
 CalendarView(
  eventHandlers: CalendarEventHandlers(
    onEventTapped: (event) async {
      // Check if the event that was tapped is is currently selected.
      eventController.selectedEvent == event
        // If it is selected, deselect it.
        ? eventController.deselectEvent()
        // If it is not selected, select it.
        : eventController.selectEvent(event);
    },
    onEventChanged: (initialDateTimeRange, event) async {
      // If you want to deselect the event after it has been resized/rescheduled. uncomment the following line.
      // eventController.deselectEvent();
    },
    onEventChangeStart: (event) {
      // You can give the user some haptic feedback here.
    },

  ),
)       
```


## Additional information

<!--TODO: Complete this-->
### Calendar Views
There are a few constructors that you can choose from to create a CalendarView.

1. **Default Constructor** - this constructor will build the correct view (MultiDay, Month, Schedule) based on the ViewConfiguration you pass it.

2. **MultiDayView** - this constructor will build a MultiDayView.

3. **MonthView** - this constructor will build a MonthView and does not need the multiDayTileBuilder.

4. **ScheduleView** - this constructor will build a ScheduleView and does not need the multiDayTileBuilder.

### View Configuration
The CalendarView takes a ViewConfiguration object, which allows you to configure the view to your liking.
The view configuration serves the following purposes:
- It contains the functions that calculate the date indices that are used by the PageView's/ScrollablePositionedList.
- It contains various parameters that are used by the CalendarView:
  1. To layout event tiles.
  2. To determine user interaction with the calendar.


There are 3 'Types' of ViewConfiguration's: MultiDayViewConfiguration, MonthViewConfiguration and ScheduleViewConfiguration.
* You can create a Custom ViewConfiguration by extending one of these 'Types'.

These are the default ViewConfiguration's:

1. **DayConfiguration** - This configuration is used to configure the MultiDayView for a single day.
    <details><summary>Example</summary>

    ```dart
    DayConfiguration(
      // This is the width of the timeline.
      timelineWidth: 56, 

      // This is the spacing between the left side of the calendar and the hour lines.
      hourLineLeftMargin: 56, 

      // This is the height of the multi day tile.
      multiDayTileHeight: 24, 

      // This determines if events should snap to other events.
      eventSnapping: true,

      // This determines if events should snap to the time indicator.
      timeIndicatorSnapping: true, 

      // This determines if the user can create events.
      createEvents: true,

      // This determines if the user can create multi day events.
      createMultiDayEvents: true, 
      
      // This determines if the user can resize events.
      enableResizing: true,

      // This determines if the user can reschedule events.
      enableRescheduling: true,

      // This is the vertical step that events will snap to.
      verticalStepDuration: const Duration(minutes: 15),

      // This is the range that events will use to snap to other events/time indicator.
      verticalSnapRange: const Duration(minutes: 15),

      // This is the default duration of a new event.
      newEventDuration: const Duration(minutes: 15), 

      // This is the start hour of the calendar.
      startHour: 0, 

      // This is the end hour of the calendar.
      endHour: 24, 
    );
    ```

### Event Handling
The CalendarView can take a CalendarEventHandlers object.
The CalendarEventHandlers handles the user's interaction with the calendar. (Do not confuse the CalendarEventHandlers with the EventsController)

There are 5 events at this time that can be handled.


**Group 1:**

1. **onEventChangeStart**: this function is called when an event is about to be changed.

2. **onEventChanged**: this function is called when an event displayed on the calendar is changed. (resized or moved)

3. **onEventTapped**: this function is called when an event displayed on the calendar is tapped.

**Group 2:**

1. **onCreateEvent**: this function is called when a new event is created by the calendar.

2. **onEventCreated**: this function is called once all operations on the new event is complete.

**Other:**

1. **onDateTapped**: this function is called when a date on the calendar is tapped.

  <details><summary>Example Code</summary>

  ```dart
  CalendarEventHandlers<Event>(
    onEventChangeStart: (CalendarEvent<T> event) {
      // This function is called when an event is about to be changed.

      // Use full on mobile for haptic feedback.
    }
    onEventChanged: (DateTimeRange initialDateTimeRange, CalendarEvent<Event> calendarEvent) async {
      // The initialDateTimeRange is the original DateTimeRange of the event so if the user wants to undo the change you can use this value.
      // The event is a reference to the event that was changed so you can update the event here.

      // This is a async function, so you can do any async work here.

      // Once this function is complete the calendar will rebuild.
    },
    onEventTapped: (CalendarEvent<Event> calendarEvent) async {
      // The calendarEvent is a reference to the event that was tapped.

      // This is a async function, so you can do any async work here.

      // Once this function is complete the calendar will rebuild.
    },
    onCreateEvent: (DateTimeRange dateTimeRange) {
      // The dateTimeRange is the range that the user has selected.

      // If the event was created by with a "drag" gesture then
      // the dateTimeRange assigned here will be modified by the drag gesture before
      // the onEventCreated function is called.

      // Return the new calendar event.
      return CalendarEvent(
        dateTimeRange: dateTimeRange,
        eventData: Event(
          title: 'Event 1',
          color: Colors.blue,
        ),
      );
    }
    onEventCreated: (CalendarEvent<Event> calendarEvent) async {
      // The calendarEvent is the new event that was created.

      // This is a async function, so you can do any async work here.

      // add the event to the eventsController.
      eventsController.addEvent(calendarEvent);

      // Once this function is complete the calendar will rebuild.
    },
    onDateTapped: (DateTime date) {
      // The date is the date header that was tapped. see example for use case.
    },
    onPageChanged: (DateTimeRange visibleDateTimeRange) {
      // The visibleDateTimeRange is the visible DateTimeRange of the new page.
    },
  );
  ```
    
  </details>
  



### Events Controller
The CalendarView takes a EventsController object.
The EventsController is used to store and manage CalendarEvent's.
(Do not confuse the EventsController with EventHandling)

| Function      | Parameters    | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| addEvent      | CalendarEvent\<T\> event | Adds this event to the list and rebuilds the calendar view  |
| addEvents     | List\<CalendarEvent\<T\>> events  | Adds these events to the list and rebuilds the calendar view |
| removeEvent   | CalendarEvent\<T\> event  | Removes this event from the list and rebuilds the calendar view |
| removeWhere   | bool Function(CalendarEvent\<T\> element) test  | Removes the event(s) where the test returns true  |
| clearEvents   |   | Clears the list of stored events  |
| updateEvent   | T? newEventData, DateTimeRange? newDateTimeRange,bool modifiable,bool Function(CalendarEvent<T> calendarEvent) test, | Updates the eventData and/or newDateTimeRange and/or modifiable (if provided), of the event where the test returns true  | 
| selectEvent   |  CalendarEvent<T> event | Selects the given event. |
| deselectEvent | | Deselects the selected event. |
| forceUpdate | | Forces the calendar to update the UI. |


### Calendar Controller
The CalendarView takes a CalendarController object.
The CalendarController is used to control the CalendarView.

| Function      | Parameters    | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| animateToNextPage | Duration? duration, Curve? curve | Animates to the next page. |
| animateToPreviousPage | Duration? duration, Curve? curve | Animates to the previous page. |
| jumpToPage  | int page  | Jumps to the given page.  |

| animateToEvent  | CalendarEvent<T> event, {Duration? duration, Curve? curve}  | Animates to the CalendarEvent.  | 
| lockScrollPhysics  |   | Locks the vertical scroll of the current view. | 
| unlockScrollPhysics  | ScrollPhysics? scrollPhysics | Unlocks the vertical scroll of the current view. | 


### Custom Object
The CalendarEvent can contain any object. This object can be accessed by the tileBuilders and the CalendarEventHandlers.

Custom Object Example:
```dart
CalendarEvent<Event>(
  dateTimeRange: DateTimeRange(),
  eventData: Event(
    title: 'Event 1',
    color: Colors.blue,
  ),
);
```

Tile Builder Example:
```dart
Widget _tileBuilder(CalendarEvent<Event> event, tileConfiguration) {
  final customObject = event.eventData;
  return Card(
    color: customObject.color,
    child: Text(customObject.title),
  );
}
```

### Calendar Layout Delegates
There are three types of layout controllers: DayLayoutController, MultiDayLayoutController, and MonthLayoutController.

1. EventGroupLayoutDelegate 
   Create your own EventGroupLayoutDelegate by extending the EventGroupLayoutDelegate class.
  ```dart
  class CustomLayoutDelegate<T> extends EventGroupLayoutDelegate<T> {
    CustomLayoutDelegate({
      required super.events, // The events that are in the group.
      required super.startOfGroup, // The datetime that the group starts.
      required super.heightPerMinute, // The height per minute of the view.
      required super.startHour, // The start hour of the view.
      required super.endHour, // The end hour of the view.
    });
    
    @override
    void performLayout(Size size) {}
  }
  ```

2. MultiDayEventGroupLayoutDelegate
   Create your own MultiDayLayoutDelegate by extending the MultiDayEventGroupLayoutDelegate class.
  ```dart
  class CustomLayoutDelegate<T> extends MultiDayEventGroupLayoutDelegate<T> {
    CustomLayoutDelegate({
      required super.events, // The events that are in the group.
      required super.visibleDateRange, // The visible date range of the view.
      required super.multiDayTileHeight, // The height of the multi day tile.
    });
    
    @override
    void performLayout(Size size) {}
  }
  ```




### Appearance
The CalendarView consists of quite a few sub components:
Each of these components can be customized in the CalendarStyle object or by passing a custom widget builder through the CalendarComponents object.

1. CalendarHeader - This is a custom widget that you can pass to the calendar to render in the header of the calendar.
